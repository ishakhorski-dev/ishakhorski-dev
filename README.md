## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan Shakhorski, a passionate software engineer specializing in modern web development with Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and TypeScript. I have extensive experience in building Single Page Applications (SPA) and Progressive Web Apps (PWA), with a strong focus on crafting efficient frontend architectures that prioritize scalability and performance.

In addition to my frontend expertise, I bring hands-on experience in backend development using Node.js, allowing me to deliver full-stack solutions that are both robust and maintainable. I'm a firm believer in clean code, test-driven development, and continuously leveraging modern frameworks to create high-quality, scalable products.

Feel free to explore my work and projects below â€” let's build something amazing together!
